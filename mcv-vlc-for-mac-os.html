I have a local Synology share that holds a bunch of video files. When I open a movie in VLC for macOS or in the Finder, it plays the video immediately. But in Windows, opening the video in Explorer or VLC downloads/copies the file to PC's hard drive first before playing it. What accounts for this difference and how can I get Windows to immediately play or stream local network files instead of downloading.

The iOS App Store, on the other hand, is very broad, with a wide range of popular (mainstream) apps and a nice design. So is the Google Play Store and Windows Store.

Hi, so I‘ve had my new iMac 2019 for a couple of weeks now and been quite happy with it. Specs are: 27", 3,6 GHz 8 core, 64 GB RAM (upgraded myself from 8GB factory), Radeon Pro Verga 48, 1 TB SSD. Running the latest non-beta Mojave at the moment. It‘s been running exceptionally well, compared to my 1st gen 5K from late 2014. Since last Friday, it had it shut off for a couple of days, and when I restarted the iMac on Tuesday, the oddest behavior started to set in. Here‘s some of the symptoms. # Getting started with r/NHLStreams Updated: April 2019 ## 1.

I've been trying to figure this out myself for days, but have made no progress lately. I'll try to keep this as short as I can, but there's quite a bit to summarize here. TL;DR: I want to make a time lapse. I'm pretty sure that I have a great set up to make it happen, but there's parts of the equation I haven't figured out. Here's a very summarized recap of what I've tried so far: First I used my Raspberry Pi B3 and Raspbian Stretch, along with PiGrow. ( r/pigrow (https://www.reddit.com/.

If indifferent, put N/A. 10-13" This is my 2 cents on what I found after weeks of research. macOS doesn't support 4K DRM as of now (Mojave), so you can't stream 2160p from Prime or Netflix at all. If you have HDR 4K rips, that you can't play using mpv, vlc, plex etc. either because HDR peak computation isn't supported yet. amp#x200B; Using mpv with config --hdr-compute-peak=yes would throw you the following error. compute shaders=0, SSBO=0; both of these are required for HDR to work properly.

I thought this is maybe the right place to present you my thoughts about making a customized version of Ubuntu with the elegant design of macOS Mojave. Why? Well at first because I really admire the spirit behind all the creators of great GTK-Themes and want to offer people a already pre-customized out of the box feeling. Because if you first have to do a lot of terminal interaction and stuff just to get all the Themes and Icon-Sets, Docks Extensions etc. right at it's place. Hey, all, I recently bought a Kingston A400 480GB 2.5" SSD to replace the Samsung 500GB HDD that came with my MacBookPro9,2 (13" mid-2012 model). Since then, around every 5–30 minutes, a certain process will hang for 5–60 seconds (e.g. saving a file, VLC whilst playing video, a single tab in Chrome, etc.) whilst the rest of the system remains operational. I have switched back to the HDD and can confirm that the issue is not present with the HDD; only the SSD seems to cause the issue. \ \ Total budget and country of purchase :\ \ 0, buying from the US \ \ Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money?
